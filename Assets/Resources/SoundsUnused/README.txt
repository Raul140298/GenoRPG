~All sounds were ripped with high quality from the SMRPG rom, with the recording tool "Audicity"
~All sounds were ripped as mono, becuase of size issues.  Mono still has the awsome quality as stereo, but with less size.
~The echos in the sounds are manditory.  They were echoed for a reason. (plus I don't know how to take out the echo =P)
